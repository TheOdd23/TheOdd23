### Hello there 👋

I'm Anthony Hébert, a former student at 42 Québec, actively seeking exciting career opportunities.

Passionate about games (Video Games 🎮, Escape Games 🔓, and Boardgames 🎲), music 🎶, multimedia creation 🎚️ and everything that involves enigmas 🔍, puzzles 🧠, and problem-solving 🕵️‍♂️. Coding not only scratches that same itch for me, but also makes me eager to dig deeper into this vast domain through a dynamic and engaging work environment, where I can put my skills to meaningful use!

- `C`

- `Shell/Bash`
- `Git`
- `Docker`
- `Networking`
- `Typescript`, `React`, `NestJs`, `REST Api`, `CSS`, `HTML`, `HTTP Requests`, `Web Sockets`

👨‍💻 Things I've learned from my internship at Korem:
