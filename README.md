### Hello there 👋

I'm Anthony Hébert, a former student at 42 Québec, actively seeking exciting career opportunities.

Passionate about games (Video Games🎮, Escape Games🔓, and Boardgames🎲), music🎶, multimedia creation🎚️ and everything that involves enigmas🔍, puzzles🧠, and problem-solving🕵️‍♂️. Coding not only scratches that same itch for me, but also makes me eager to dig deeper into this vast domain through a dynamic and engaging work environment, where I can put my skills to meaningful use!

🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects to learn new concepts and languages. One of them involves developing the backend for a small game on Unity with `C#` and `.NET`.

🎓 Some languages and concepts I've learned through 42' s projects:
- `C`
- `C++/OOP`
- `Shell/Bash`
- `Git`
- `Docker`
- `Networking`
- `Typescript`, `React`, `NestJs`, `REST Api`, `CSS`, `HTML`, `HTTP Requests`, `Web Sockets`

👨‍💻 Things I've learned from my internship at Korem:
- `Agile Method`
- `Jira`
- `Python`
- `DeckGL` and other Geospatial tools 🌏
- `Java`
- `Kotlin`
- `Javascript`
- `PostGIS/SQL`
